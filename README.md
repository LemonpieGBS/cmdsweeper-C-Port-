<p id="description">[og description] cmdsweeper is a clone of the popular windows game Minesweeper. With the twist of it being completely playable from your console! Use WASD to move your cursor enter to mine a field and B to flag one! This project is build entirely on C++ and was made as a proof of concept while trying to learn how to program. Hope you enjoy!

I decided to port it to C# to kind of learn how the language compares to C++, it was a great success!
The only notable changes I've been able to see are:
- The cursor lights up in red only the frame the key is pressed due to how input is managed in C#
- To prevent crashes, matches that exceed the console frame can NOT be generated at all, to generate a bigger match you need to zoom out the console beforehand
- Some difficulties like master may not be available on the default console size</p>
